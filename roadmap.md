*   **HTTPS:** Secure site.
*   **Clean URL Structure:** User-friendly and SEO-friendly (e.g., `domain.com/blog/how-to-pack-kitchen`).
*   **Schema Markup:**
    *   `LocalBusiness` (or `MovingCompany` specialization) for the main business and branch locations.
    *   `Service` for each service offered.
    *   `Article` or `BlogPosting` for blog posts.
    *   `FAQPage` for the FAQ page.
    *   `BreadcrumbList` for navigation.
    *   `Review` or `AggregateRating` for testimonials.
*   **XML Sitemap:** Auto-generated and submitted to Google Search Console.
*   **Robots.txt:** Properly configured.
*   **Internal Linking Strategy:** Create content silos; link relevant pages and posts together to distribute link equity and improve navigation.
*   **Image Optimization:** Compress images, use descriptive filenames, and provide meaningful alt text for all images. Use modern formats like WebP.
*   **Structured Headings (H1-H6):** Logical hierarchy on every page. One H1 per page.
*   **Meta Tags:** Unique, compelling, and keyword-optimized title tags and meta descriptions for every page.
*   **Canonicals:** Properly implement canonical tags to avoid duplicate content issues.
*   **Accessibility (WCAG AA):** Strive for good accessibility.
*   **Multilingual Considerations (if applicable):** Implement `hreflang` correctly if offering content in both Arabic and English. Initially, focus on the primary language for KSA (Arabic for many transactional queries, English for some informational/expat queries). Prioritize content creation in the language with the highest search volume for target keywords. The main website and navigation elements could be bilingual.

**IV. E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) Implementation:**

*   **Experience:** Showcase years in business, case studies (if possible via blog posts "How we moved X"), testimonials focusing on specific challenges overcome.
*   **Expertise:**
    *   Detailed service descriptions.
    *   In-depth blog content written by identifiable authors with credentials/experience highlighted (`/public/images/author/author_name.png` for author image).
    *   FAQ page answering common and complex customer questions.
*   **Authoritativeness:**
    *   Prominently display licenses, accreditations, and insurance.
    *   Professional website design and branding.
    *   Obtain local citations and backlinks from reputable Saudi Arabian directories and businesses.
    *   Encourage and display genuine customer reviews (Google Business Profile, website).
*   **Trustworthiness:**
    *   Clear contact information (NAP).
    *   Secure website (HTTPS).
    *   Transparent pricing (even if via a "Get a Quote" system, explain factors affecting cost).
    *   Clear privacy policy and terms of service.
    *   Excellent customer service responsiveness.

**V. Content & Design Tone:**

*   **Professional, Reliable, Helpful, Friendly, Trustworthy.**
*   **Language:** Primary: Arabic. Secondary: English (especially for blog content targeting expats or specific keywords). The prompt focuses on English structure for AI, but generated content needs to be high-quality Arabic, localized for Saudi dialect where appropriate.
*   **Imagery:** High-quality, professional photos reflecting Saudi Arabia context where possible. Avoid generic stock photos if unique assets are available. Use specified paths:
    *   Blog post featured images/inline images: `/public/images/blog/`
    *   Service page images: `/public/images/`
    *   General site images (hero, etc.): `/public/images/`

**VI. Local SEO Focus (Critical for KSA):**

*   **Google Business Profile (GBP) Optimization:** This is separate from the website build but integral. Ensure website links correctly to a fully optimized GBP listing (NAP consistency, services, Q&A, photos, posts, reviews).
*   **NAP Consistency:** Name, Address, Phone number must be consistent across the website, GBP, and all online citations.
*   **Location-Specific Pages:** As described in Section I.3.
*   **Local Keywords:** Target keywords including city names (e.g., "نقل عفش الرياض", "شركة نقل اثاث جدة").
*   **Encourage Reviews:** Strategically ask satisfied customers for reviews on Google and other relevant platforms.

**VII. Call to Actions (CTAs):**

*   Primary CTA: "Get a Free Quote" / "احصل على عرض سعر مجاني"
*   Secondary CTAs: "Call Us Now," "Learn More," "Read Our Blog," "Book Your Move."
*   CTAs should be prominent, clear, and contextually relevant on each page.

**Technology Stack Suggestion (for Cursor AI):**
*   Frontend: React/Next.js for performance and SEO benefits.
*   Styling: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
*   CMS for Blog: Headless CMS (e.g., Sanity, Strapi, Contentful) or Next.js file-based routing for Markdown/MDX.
*   Deployment: Vercel or Netlify for ease of use and performance.

**Final Deliverable Expectation from Cursor AI:**
A fully structured codebase for the website and blog, incorporating all the sections, pages, and SEO best practices outlined above. Placeholder text ("Lorem Ipsum") can be used for detailed content where specific text is not provided, but structure, headings, and CTAs should be in place. HTML should be semantically correct. Emphasis on generating clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

This prompt should provide Cursor AI with enough detailed instruction to generate a robust and professional foundation for your moving company's website. Remember that human oversight, content creation (especially high-quality Arabic content), and ongoing SEO efforts will be crucial post-development.
